Scenario Outline: Add new group
    Given a group list
    Given a group with <name>, <header>, <footer>
    When I add the group to the list
    Then the new group list is equal to the old list with the added group

    Examples:
    | name | header | footer |
    | name1| header1| footer1|
    | name2| header2| footer2|
    | name3| header3| footer3|

Scenario: Delete a group
    Given a non-empty group list
    Given a random group from the list
    When I delete the group from the list
    Then the new group list is equal to the old group list without the deleted group
